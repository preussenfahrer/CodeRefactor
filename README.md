# CodeRefactor

## Description

This project involved getting a set of HTML and CSS code that had some problems, namely in the organization of the HTML and CSS. For our first homework assignment, we were instructed to go through the documents (after pulling them from GitHub and making a repository) and identify elements that needed to be fixed. The first thing that needed to be removed were the <div> elements in the HTML code, and replaced with Semantic HTML. This was done to make the webpage up to present practices and standards, in addition to showing us (as the students in the bootcamp) the importance of keeping with best practices as we begin this course. The CSS was not so much erroneous, but it was somewhere around 200 lines of code, much of which could be streamlined under one line of multiple clasess with the same style information. I am sure that I missed some things here and could have condensed it even more, but to get it under 150 lines I thought would be a good effort for the first crack at serious coding.
